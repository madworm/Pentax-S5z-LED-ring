Pentax-S5z-LED-ring
===================

LAYOUT FILES: LED ring for my old Pentax S5z digital camera.

The center-hole diameter is 28mm and the board slides right over the extended objective.

You will find code for this project in [this](https://github.com/madworm/ATtiny_projects/tree/master/13/PT4115_PWM) repository.

Before having PC-boards made, please make sure you know about your manufacturer's peculiarities!
Especially drill-sizes and their tolerances may vary too much and give you trouble.
